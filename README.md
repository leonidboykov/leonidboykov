### Hi there, I'm [Leonid Boykov](https://leonidboykov.com) :wave:

Hi, I am Leonid Boykov, a developer from Russia.

#### My current stack of techologies

I'm interested various areas of coding stuff, like web or gamedev:

  * My main editor is **VS Code**.
  * **Go** is my primary language of choise for any new application
  * I use **Hugo** to build most of my static websites. I'm also trying Gatsby from time to time.
  * I'm mastering **React** to build my webapps.
  * I really like gamedev, I used to make games with Godot, Gideros, libGDX, Love2D and Unity. I'm also considering an Unreal Engine and Defold.
  * At home I'm using **Docker** to manage my apps.
  * Huge **Lua** fan for some reason.

At the moment I'm learning CMake and OpenGL to create my own game engine!

My daytime job is a C++ developer at [SeaProject](https://seaproject.ru) company.
